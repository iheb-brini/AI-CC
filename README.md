# AI-CC
In this repository, you will find the notebooks for the Machine Learning & AI Course for Beginners.

The course is divided into several parts, each part containing a set of notebooks.

The notebooks are organized in the following way:

- Part 1: Starter Notebooks: [hello_work_AI](01_hello_work_AI/)
- Part 2: ML Classification tasks: [binary_classification](02_1_binary_classification/) and [multi_class_classification](02_2_multi_class_classification/)
- Part 3: MLRegression tasks: [regression](03_regression/)

Each notebook is a self-contained project that demonstrates a specific machine learning concept.

The notebooks are written in Python and use the following libraries:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)


Part 4: Neural Networks: [Neural_networks](04_Neural_networks/)
This notebook demonstrates how to build a neural network for a regression task.

The neural netwokr implementation is written in PyTorch:
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

## How to run the notebooks

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies
3. Run the notebooks

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mishalko/AI-CC.git
cd AI-CC
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the notebooks

```bash
jupyter notebook
```


All the data is in the [datasets/](datasets/) folder, and don't need extra dependencies (unless specified in the notebook).
